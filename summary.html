<center><p><h1>Overview</h1></p></center>
<center><p>The PA-RIDE WEBSITE is the target client of this information security policies. In relation to inherent Risk Profile and Risk Assessment Form we develop and look for policies and strategies that will fit to the problems of the organization in terms of securing data and information. The policies that we suggest are Security Response Plan Policy,Information Logging Standard,and Password Protection Policy.</p></center>

<center><p>We concluded that this organization still had a number of issues to deal with.Despite being small,this organization must nevertheless safeguard information and data.Also this company doesn't run entirely on IT,which makes it vulnerable to external effects and unauthorized access to sensitive data. We don't want PA-RIDE and Passengers data and information to be lost or misused.We thought that future legislation would address the fact that these guidelines won't fully address all concerns with securing the organization's information and data.</p></center>
<center><p>There is a lot to think about when it comes to protecting the organization's information and data.As a company or organization that holds data and information about every individual in your organization and its customers,you most important responsibility is to keep it safe from unauthorized access and modifications.Thi recommendation is very simple;It is necessary and recommended to hire information security professionals who will research,analyze,and create these rules. However,if these policies are only put down on paper and circulated,they are meaningless.To ensure that the policies are followed and that everyone is protected,they should be presented to all company employees.They should also analyze,evalute,and improve all security procedures and equipment on an annual basis.</p></center>
