<center><p><h1>Overview</h1></p></center>
<center><p>A Security Response Plan (SRP) provides the impetus for security and business teams to integrate their efforts
	from the perspective of awareness and communication, as well as coordinated response in times of crisis (security vulnerability identified or exploited). Specifically, an SRP defines a product description, contact information, escalation paths, expected service level agreements (SLA), severity and impact classification, and mitigation/remediation timelines.
	By requiring business unit to incorporate an SRP as part of their business continuity operations and as a new products
or services are developed and prepared for release to consumer, ensures, that when an incident occurs, swift mitigation and remediation ensues.</p></center>

<center></title><h1>Policy</h1></title></center>
<center><p>The Development, implementation,and execution of a Security Respone Plan (SRP) are the primary responsibility
of the specific busines unit for whom the SRP is being developed in cooperation with the Infosec Team. Business units are expected to properly facilitate the SRP for applicable to the service or products they are held accountable. The business unit security coordinator or champion is further expected to work with the E-trike Drivers Association in the development and maintenance of a Security Response Plan.</p></center>
